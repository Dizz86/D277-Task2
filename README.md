Scenario
You have a job interview for an entry-level position on the web development team for a state government office. After inquiring about your education, skills, and experience, the hiring manager has asked you to create a page layout as part of the interview process. If you are hired, you will use this page layout to fully develop a new website for the state government office.
Requirements

Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.


You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.


Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).


A.  Create two low-level comprehensive page layouts that can be used to develop a 4–10-page website related to a U.S. state. The first layout should introduce the state (i.e., the main page) and the second layout should be for individual city pages (i.e., the state capital and two additional cities in the state).

1. Include clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements for each page of the website:

•   a header containing introductory content (pertaining to the document as a whole or a particular section of a document)

•   a nav to place the links that allow users to navigate the site

•   a section to display the main content of the page

•   an aside to display information related to the content

Note: The low-level comprehensive page layout of your main elements for the cities will remain the same on each page, but you will customize the content on each of the pages in the next task. Realistically most sites will have several different templates for different types of pages. You are only being asked to create two pages for this task.

Note: You can use any tool to create the low-level comprehensive layout, such as graphic creation or manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.

B.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
